# Postmodern
_Note: this project is currently in the [prototyping](https://github.com/DeadSuperHero/postmodern/issues/1) stage./_

__Postmodern__ is a blogging / article platform powered by ActivityPub and written with Elixir. The goal of the platform is to develop a hybrid feed reader /
content syndication platform built around the concept of federated subscriptions
and delivery. The design emphasis is to shift away from a Medium-style to
something more geared towards an article website.
